# Asthma-Detection
Python-based Asthma Detection Program
##Basic Introduction
This program is an asthma detection tool written in Python, with a sample consisting of 50 asthma patients and 50 healthy controls. The program uses two machine learning models—Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF)—for training. The process includes:

Importing necessary libraries

Loading and processing data

Splitting data into training and testing sets

Data normalization

Hyperparameter tuning

Model training and evaluation

Generating confusion matrix

Plotting ROC curve
